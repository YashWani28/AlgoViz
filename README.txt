AlgoViz is a project to help learners visualize various DSA algorithms. Currently six sorting algorithms: merge sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, quick sort, heap sort and selection sort are visualized using animations. The array which these algorithms sort is depicted as a bar graph. Similarly, in the searching part, BFS and DFS is currently implemened. The algorithms find a path from the source to destination node which the user can select in the grid. The user can also add obstacles. In future implementations, more algos like A* search, Greedy search etc. will also be added.
